Q3.

sum_series.py

The file sum_series.py accepts a number N from the user and prints the following series

Series: 1/1! + 2/2! +3/3! + …. + N/N!

Function used: sum_series().
Argument of the function: the number accepted from the user 'num'.

A number 'num' is accepted from the user.
The function sum_series() is called.

Execution of the function:

                         >>> A variable 'sum' is initialised to 0.
			 >>> Variable 'fact' is initialised to 1.
			 >>> In the for loop that ranges from 1 to num+1 :
			 
			                                                  >>> Factorial is calculated by corresponding equation.
								          >>> Sum is calculated by corresponding equation.
								     
			 >>> Sum is returned to the calling function.
			 
Sum of the series is printed.
